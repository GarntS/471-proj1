# test_eval() returns a random board evaluation in [-10, 10]
# @param board  a python-chess board object containing the current board state

#               NOTE: negative evaluations are good for the minimizing player
#               and vice versa. the scale of your evaluations is up to you.
#               NOTE: the player who goes first is always the maximizing player,
#               and when playing chess, white goes first.

# TODO(y'all):  implement one more evaluation function, more-thorough than just
#               counting pieces and/or weighting their positions like in the
#               above examples.
